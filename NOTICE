Partners, Inc [0]. The code was released by Novus under this license in
2013. Adam Klein remains lead developer. Saddle was inspired by earlier
prototypes developed by Chris Lewis, Cheng Peng, & David Cru. Saddle was
also inspired by pandas [1], a data analysis library written in Python,
whose development is led by Wes McKinney.
